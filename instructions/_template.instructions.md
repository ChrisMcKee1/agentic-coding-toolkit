Follow these rules:

1. Keep changes minimal and focused.
2. Match existing style and naming patterns.
3. Prefer root-cause fixes over workarounds.
4. Avoid unrelated refactors.

Notes:
- Use the `.instructions.md` extension.
- Keep instruction file names lower-case and hyphenated.
- `applyTo` is used for automatic matching; in GitHub path-specific instructions, `applyTo` is required.
